<p><b>Dearest Cypress partner,
  <div class="a">As you may already know, I will be taking a leave of absence from Starbucks with my last shift being tonight's Sunday close. During this time, I will focus on re-prioritizing my studies and attempting to re-evaluate myself and skill sets beyond customer service. Having been a partner for nearly 5 years at two locations has brought me many fond memories, great friendships, and countless lessons. More importantly, it has also brought me a sense of comfort and stability that I have greatly relied on in the past. However, I realize that the comfort that I have enjoyed has kept me from pushing myself towards even some of my more practical goals in life.
</div>
</p>
<div class="a">
<p>I admit that I have yet to figure many things out for myself and have avoided both tough questions and taking on greater responsibility at the expense of my own personal growth. This sense of stagnancy has festered within me for more than I would like to admit, but thankfully was at times easy to forget thanks to you guys. I am very thankful for this store and my partners so the last thing I would want is to make anyone think that I am fed up with them or the whole store. I am simply only tired of the way I have decided to handle or (not handle) my own business and that is completely on me.
</div>
</p>
<div class="a">
<p> Now, I cannot guarantee that I will in fact return this September, but I am also not ruling it out. With this I hope to have clarified my reasons for leaving beyond the risk of COVID-19, especially for partners that I do not see quite as often.  I look forward to visiting you guys from time to time and eventually being able to share any progress I make. Thanks for reading this and thanks for being a hard team to leave.<br>
Best,<br>
Baldemar Esquivel III<br>
